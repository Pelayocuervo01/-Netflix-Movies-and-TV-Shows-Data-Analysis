# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to uncover interesting trends and patterns in their content. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we perform the following steps:

## Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

*   Import the dataset and handle missing or inconsistent data.
*   Clean and preprocess data for analysis, such as extracting dates, filling missing values, and categorizing shows.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

*   Analyze the distribution of show categories, identifying popular genres.
*   Visualize the growth of Netflix content over the years.
*   Compare the trends of movies and TV shows added to the platform.

## Visualization:

*   Create informative charts and graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib to present the findings.
*   Visualize trends and patterns in data.

## Key insights:

*   The dataset reveals insights into the most popular show categories, release year trends, and overall content growth on Netflix.
*   Visualizations provide a clear and concise representation of the data, making it easy to understand the trends.

## Usage:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
